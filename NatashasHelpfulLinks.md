When building for ServiceWorker I use a bunch of links to help me get started and understand ServiceWorkers and the other APIs which help make them work. Please check these out to help you build apps, and suggest links in a PR!

## Tutorials and Implementations

* [Is Service Worker Ready Yet](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/) - Jake Archibald made a great website which details ServiceWorker implementations across the major browsers.
* [ServiceWorkers and Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/06/serviceworkers-and-firefox/) - Introduction to ServiceWorkers on Firefox!
* [Service Worker - first draft published](http://jakearchibald.com/2014/service-worker-first-draft/) - Introduction and tutorial including code snippets!
* [Video: The ServiceWorker: The network layer is yours to own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uQMl7mFB6g) - video introducing ServiceWorker including HTTP caching, request, and showing SW in forms, the basis for push messaging, alarms, geofencing and background sync.

## Debugging

* ServiceWorkerInternals (chrome canary only - chrome://serviceworker-internals/) - page for debugging ServiceWorkers in chrome, including stopping, unregistering and starting workers.

## Examples

* [Jake Archibald's Trained to Thrill](https://jakearchibald.github.io/trained-to-thrill/) - Jake made a great demo app which pulls in images from Flickr, uses fetch, uses cache (not implemented yet) and worker registrations.
* [Simple ServiceWorker](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/serviceworker-simple) - A simple Service Worker example by Matt Andrews.

## Other APIs

* [Promises HTML5Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/) - Understanding Promises (used frequently in ServiceWorkers especially in fetch, cache). 
* [The Basics of Web Workers](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/workers/basics/) - Understanding concurrency in JavaScript and how web workers work.
